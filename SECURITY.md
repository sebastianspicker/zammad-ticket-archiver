# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security updates are provided on a best-effort basis. Prefer running the latest released version and keep
dependencies patched.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues responsibly:
- Do **not** open a public GitHub issue.
- Include reproduction steps, expected impact, and (if possible) a minimal proof-of-concept.

Contact:
- Prefer GitHub private vulnerability reporting (Security Advisories) if enabled for this repository.
- If that is not available in your environment, use your organisation’s established security contact path
  for the maintainers of this service.
